# 1. for loop
'''
The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. 
Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers, 
or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), 

Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence 
(a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. 
For example :

'''

vs = 'hello python'
for i in vs:
    print(i)

for i in vs:
    if i == ' ':
        break
    print(i)

#The break statement, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop
# break just stop the iteration within the loop



#The continue statement, continues with the next iteration of the loop:
